Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!"); 

// Notes:
/*
1. Hello, World! is a common first program for beginners in programming.
2. The Main method is the entry point for the program. Satic keyword means the class cannot be instantiated.
3. Console is a class in the System namespace that provides methods for input and output.
4. WriteLine is a method in the Console class that writes a line of text to the console.
5. The new C# allows you write code without a class or Main method. (Top-level statements)
