## Hello World

This demonstrates the basic syntax for printing "Hello World" to the console. It introduces the `Console.WriteLine()` method used to output text.

## Namespaces

This shows how to use namespaces to organize code. It includes classes grouped into different namespaces to avoid naming conflicts and illustrate their usage.

## Keywords in C#

This introduces various C# keywords and their usage, such as `class`, `public`, `private`, `static`, `void`, `int`, `return`, `new`, `if`, `else`, and more.

## Classes and Objects

This demonstrates the concepts of classes and objects in C#. It includes defining a class with properties and methods and creating objects of that class.

## Variables

This illustrates different types of variables in C#, such as `int`, `string`, `double`, `bool`, and `char`. It covers how to declare, initialize, and use variables in calculations.

## C-Sharp Type System

C# has two categories of type.

### 1. Value Types
- Only contain its data
- Examples include: 
    - int
    - float
    - doule
    - decimal
    - bool
    - char


### 2. Referrence Types
- Stores reference to there data objects.
- Examples include:
    - class
    - intefaces
    - arrays
    - strings
    - tuples
    - records
    - dynamic
